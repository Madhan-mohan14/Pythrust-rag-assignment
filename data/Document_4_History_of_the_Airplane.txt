# History of the Airplane

## Introduction
The invention of the airplane by the Wright brothers in 1903 forever changed global travel and transportation. Their successful powered flight marked the beginning of modern aviation.

## Early Attempts at Flight
For centuries, humans tried to imitate birds using gliders, wings, and flying machines. Although many designs were imaginative, none achieved controlled, powered flight.

## Wright Brothers’ Breakthrough
Orville and Wilbur Wright solved key problems in flight through:
- **Three‑axis control (pitch, roll, yaw)**  
- **A lightweight internal combustion engine**  
- **Efficient propeller design**  
- **Wind‑tunnel testing**

The first flight lasted 12 seconds and covered 120 feet—but its impact echoed across history.

## Development of Aviation
### Early 1900s
Rapid innovation improved airplanes’ speed, control, and safety.

### World Wars
WWI and WWII accelerated aviation technology for defense, leading to:
- Larger aircraft  
- Better engines  
- Advanced aerodynamics  

### Commercial Aviation
By the 1930s, airlines began carrying passengers across countries and oceans.

### Jet Age
The 1950s introduced jet engines, drastically reducing travel times.

## Impact
- Globalization of trade and tourism  
- Faster movement of goods and people  
- Essential roles in emergency and military operations  

## Conclusion
From wooden gliders to supersonic jets, the airplane is one of mankind’s greatest technological achievements.
