# History of the Radio

## Introduction
Radio technology enabled wireless communication for the first time, making it possible to transmit information instantly over long distances. It changed mass media, emergency communication, and global culture.

## Scientific Foundations
### Electromagnetic Waves
James Clerk Maxwell predicted the existence of radio waves in the 1860s. Heinrich Hertz later demonstrated them experimentally.

### Early Innovations
Guglielmo Marconi applied this science to develop wireless telegraphy. In 1901, he achieved the first transatlantic radio transmission.

## Growth of Radio Communication
### Military Use
During World War I and II, radio became vital for strategic communication, navigation, and coordination.

### Broadcasting Era
The early 20th century saw the rise of:
- Radio news
