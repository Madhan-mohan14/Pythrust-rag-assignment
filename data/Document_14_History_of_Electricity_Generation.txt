# History of Electricity Generation

## Introduction
Electricity generation enabled modern civilization by powering homes, industries, communication systems, and countless technologies. It transformed daily life and industrial progress.

## Scientific Foundations
### Faraday’s Discovery (1831)
Michael Faraday discovered electromagnetic induction, enabling generators to convert mechanical energy into electricity.

## Early Power Systems
### Edison’s DC System
Thomas Edison built the first commercial power station in 1882, using direct current (DC) to power homes.

### Tesla’s AC System
Nikola Tesla’s alternating current (AC) system, supported by George Westinghouse, became the global standard due to its ability to transmit electricity long distances.
