# History of the World Wide Web

## Introduction
The World Wide Web (WWW), invented by Tim Berners-Lee in 1989, transformed the internet from a technical research tool into a global, user-friendly information system. It revolutionized communication, collaboration, business, entertainment, and nearly every aspect of modern life.

## Before the Web
Before the Web existed, the internet was a text-based network mainly used by scientists and researchers. There were:
- No websites  
- No web browsers  
- No images, videos, or clickable links  
- Only command-line tools and file transfers  

This made the internet inaccessible to the general public.

## Core Components Created by Tim Berners-Lee
### HTML (HyperText Markup Language)
The basic structure for creating web pages.

### URL (Uniform Resource Locator)
A unique address that identifies each resource online.

### HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol)
A communication system that allows browsers and servers to exchange information.

### Hypertext
The idea of linking one document to another through clickable text.

## Early Web Development
In 1991, the first website was launched. By the mid‑1990s, web browsers like Mosaic and Netscape brought images and improved navigation, which made the Web explode in popularity.

## Evolution of the Web
### Web 1.0 (1990s) — Information Web
Static websites that users could only read.

### Web 2.0 (2000s) — Social Web
Interactivity increased through:
- Social media platforms  
- Blogs and forums  
- Video sharing  
- User‑generated content  

### Web 3.0 (2010s–present) — Intelligent Web
AI-driven personalization, smart assistants, blockchain technologies, and decentralized platforms.

## Impact of the World Wide Web
1. **Education:** Free access to learning resources.  
2. **Communication:** Email, video calls, and instant messaging.  
3. **Business:** Online banking, e-commerce, digital marketing.  
4. **Entertainment:** Streaming services, games, social media.  
5. **Knowledge Sharing:** Billions of websites storing global information.  

## Conclusion
The Web transformed the digital landscape, democratized information, and continues to evolve as one of humanity’s most influential technological inventions.
