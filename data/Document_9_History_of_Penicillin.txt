# History of Penicillin

## Introduction
Penicillin, discovered in 1928 by Alexander Fleming, became the world’s first true antibiotic. It transformed medicine by providing an effective treatment for bacterial infections that once caused widespread death.

## The Accidental Discovery
Fleming accidentally noticed that a mold (Penicillium notatum) killed surrounding bacteria on a petri dish. This led him to identify the substance as penicillin.

## Development and Mass Production
Although Fleming discovered penicillin, scientists Howard Florey and Ernst Chain developed methods to purify and mass‑produce it in the 1940s. During World War II, large‑scale production saved millions of soldiers’ lives.

## Medical Importance
Penicillin effectively treats:
- Pneumonia  
- Strep throat  
- Syphilis  
- Meningitis  
- Blood infections  

## Impact on Society
1. Major reduction in infection‑related deaths  
2. Safer surgeries and medical procedures  
3. Launch of the antibiotic revolution  
4. Foundation for modern pharmaceuticals  

## Conclusion
Penicillin reshaped the medical world, saving countless lives and inspiring generations of antibiotics.
