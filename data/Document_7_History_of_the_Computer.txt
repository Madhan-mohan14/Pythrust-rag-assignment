# History of the Computer

## Introduction
The computer evolved from simple mechanical calculators into powerful digital machines capable of performing billions of operations per second. Computers now play a vital role in science, business, communication, and everyday life.

## Early Computing Concepts
### Mechanical Calculators
In the 1800s, Charles Babbage designed the Analytical Engine, considered the first conceptual computer. Ada Lovelace wrote the world’s first algorithm for it.

### Theoretical Foundations
In 1936, Alan Turing introduced the concept of a universal machine capable of performing any computation, forming the basis of modern computer science.

## Electronic Computers
### ENIAC (1946)
The first large‑scale, general‑purpose electronic computer. It used vacuum tubes and filled an entire room.

### Transistors and Microchips
During the 1950s‑60s, transistors replaced large tubes, making computers faster, smaller, and more reliable. Microprocessors in the 1970s enabled personal computers.
