His wife Bertha Benz famously took the first long‑distance car trip, proving its reliability.

## Growth of the Automobile Industry
### Henry Ford’s Assembly Line
In 1908, Ford introduced the Model T and mass production techniques, making cars affordable for ordinary families.

### Global Expansion

- Highways and road networks expanded  
- Gas stations and repair shops emerged  
- Car culture grew worldwide  

## Modern Developments
- Electric vehicles (EVs)  
- Hybrid engines  
- Autonomous driving technologies  

## Impact
Cars shaped modern life by enabling fast travel, suburban growth, and global logistics.

## Conclusion
The automobile remains one of the most significant inventions, driving economic growth and personal freedom.
